This is the back-end code for use with Twilio.

You'll need a Twilio account in order to interface with this endpoint via SMS (but I suppose you could modify it to work as a webapp).

Once you have a Twilio account, you'll need to configure your Twilio number to send web requests to this code on your server. There's plenty of documentation to walk you through this.
